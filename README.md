## Install:

    pip install git+https://github.com/VidaID/pymodinv.git  

## Use:

Python already has fast powmod, here's a modular inverse that's twice as fast as doing it in python straight.   Will add other functions if someone wants them.

    from pymodinv import modinv
    
    modinv(239084234897,23)
